# RocketClicker
My first game made July 2016.

My first working game made completely on my own with a GUI!
Still contains various bugs such as boost score not updating automatically on main menu after buying auto-clickers, buttons becoming active after purchasing, going to main menu, and coming back, etc. Could have been avoided by creating only one single page containing the button AND shop.
